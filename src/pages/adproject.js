          <h2>Development of the TEC website </h2>
          <p>
            In this project, I created a website for a non-profit organisation
            in Shanghai called TEC (The Expatriate Centre). I started from
            scratch and wrote the HTML and CSS codes for the website. It
            includes more than 50 pages and sub-pages and is compatible with
            both computer and mobile users. I managed to complete it in less
            than 2 months with my spare time out of school, and now it has been
            deployed as the official website for TEC (homepage as shown in Fig.
            1). I have also received an appreciation letter from the Chair of
            TEC (see Fig. 2).

          <h2>The UKMT math challenge â€“ gold and kangaroo qualification</h2>
          <p>
            In year 8, I attended the UKMT math challenge. Although the teacher
            did not give up any prior notice for revision, I still managed to
            answer every single question, and eventually achieved gold and a
            Kangaroo challenge qualification.
